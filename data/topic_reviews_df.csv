i started taking dosis every morning 2 weeks ago. i have had very little in the way of side effects. some mind shakiness in the morning, little bit of difficulty falling asleep, mild fatigue, and dampened appetite. the benefits - to this point - are - surprising. i am much calmer, the anxiety is 80% gone, the depression is still present but not like 2 weeks ago and before. it's dissipating for sure. life doesn't look so ""all or nothing"" which is a nice change.
my spouse said my ""fidgets"" are gone. i was almost constantly moving in some form or another.

 i could never bring myself to telling anyone how i really felt, i guess it's only the last year or so that i became more aware and really accepting that something isn't right.  it's been so long that i have felt this way, i really don't know what normal is anymore.  i have lost 2 girlfriends  largely due to my low self esteem and low confidence finally taking its toll on the relationship, it's like i just expected them to leave, who would want to stay with a loser like me is how i portrayed myself to them.. that's probably the hardest pill to swallow through all this.  i know if i was mentally stronger, i could have held on to something good.

2.	the same feeling in my throat upon waking, i drank water to cool off and see if this would stop. and it didn't.
3.	my face was tingling all over as well.
4.	moderately nauseous upon standing up or sitting down. the nausea had continued all day. had a special k cereal bar to ease this up in the morning. having only relief from it less than an hour.
5.	tried eat cereal for lunch and discovered unable to eat it at all. the taste of it was making me sicker.
6.	took two dosis acetaminophen at 0700, relief was only slight and the head aches returned less than two hours.
7.	overall neck pain eased up and other arthritic symptoms did as well. i could definitley tell a difference, however the head ache did not.


8.	decided to take a dosage during the morning at 1000 hrs. to avoid loss of bowel control in my sleep. within about two hours, felt it working through my system. same effects i mentioned as before. severe headaches and nausea all day. and of course unbearable hot and cold feelings again thinking that these should eventually pass as i become used to it.
9.	laid down from 1400 to 1700 to alleviate the symptoms. awoke from the nap and tried to eat dinner. one bite made me sick to my stomach. headaches still there.
